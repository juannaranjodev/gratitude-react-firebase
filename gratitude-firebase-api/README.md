# Gratitude Firebase API

This handles the bulk of the workload for the app

## Installation

The default Firebase Functions template places everything within the `/functions` directory, so you have to enter that directory to add and install packages. Pretty much everything you do will be within the `/functions` directory.

`cd functions && npm i`

## Directory Structure

```s
functions
  |-- credentials # this is where the credentials for firebase and twilio live. you'll need the files to get things running
  |-- lib # any reusable utility functions go here
  |-- services # all serverless endpoints and hooks go here
```

## Development

You can run this locally by running `npm run dev` from within the `/functions` directory. This will serve your functions locally. Any interface that you use can now attach to this local endpoint by adding the `useFunctionsEmulator` method:

```js
// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50884534/how-to-test-functions-https-oncall-firebase-cloud-functions-locally
export const functions = firebase.functions().useFunctionsEmulator('http://localhost:5000')
```

This is not currently set up to happen programmatically based on environment, so you'll have to change it manually.

## Deployment

`firebase deploy` deploys everything, `npm run deploy` from within `/functions` deploys just the functions.

## Specs

Using Plaid for bank account verification

Using Dwolla for ACH transfers

Twilio for sending text messages

## Thoughts

We have ACH set up with auto-account verification

We don't necessarily want to automatically make the transfer. We want to manage an account balance internally before we transfer, but we can probably use a company account as an intermediary?

`Peer 1 => Gratitude Account => Peer 2`

We'll want to do this because it might be some time before `Peer 2` collects the money given by `Peer 1`.

Schema:

```s
users {
  email: String
  dwollaAccountId: String
}

transactions {
  sourceId: String # The Id of the user who initiated the transfer
  recipientId: String # The Id of the recipient
  createdAt: DateTime
}
```

## TODO

We should use Twilio verify to verify phone numbers. We should consider at what step we want to add that level of friction.

Need to figure out if we want to support "send to email". This isn't hard to implement, but does require some extra work.
